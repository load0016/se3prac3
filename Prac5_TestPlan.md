Introduction
============

This is a Test Plan for the 2048 game. The 2048 game is made up from a 4x4 grid which spawns tiles in random places on the grid. The game begins with 2 initial tiles which both have the value of 2. The user tilts the grid to combine the tiles that have the same value. Once those tiles are combined, the value will be the sum of the two tiles. The final outcome of the game is to score 2048.

Resources Needed
================

Considering the game isnt complex, a C Complier and the program/test files will only be required. The tests will be done on a Unix Machine.
